XAS Spooler is Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Kevin L. Esteb 

XAS is a set of modules, procedures and practices to help write
consistent Perl5 code for a datacenter operations environment. For the most 
part, this follows the Unix tradition of small discrete components that
communicate in well defined ways.

This system is cross platform capable. It will run under Windows as well
as Unix like environments without a code rewrite. This allows you to
write your code once and run it where ever.

This package provides the modules and procedures to provide a spooler.
The spooler scan directories in $XAS_SPOOL and processes any files found
there. These files are converted to messages and sent to queues on
the Message Queue Server. Once queued, the collector can process and 
store them into the appropriate datastore.
